# Fractal_Generator
A program to generate images of fractals based on Mandelbrot and Julia sets using the family of funtions f(z) = z^n + c. Also able to perform conformal transformations on the on the set.

TO-DO LIST:
- Windows compatibility;
- general power fractals;
- detect identical names;
- and other image organization things;
- use boost:gil for better image manipulation;
- save image parameters after generation;

DONE:
- pallette generator;
- preview;
- 2nd and 3rd power fractals;
- Python GUI;
- progress bar;
